<h2>I </h2><p><span class="drop">T</span>he least distinguished person in ^Who^s Who* has escapedy as it were, from that fashionable crush, and is spending a quiet evening at home. He is curled up in his studio, which is so dark that he would be invisible, had we not obligingly placed his wicker chair just where the one dim ray from the stove may strike his face. His eyes are closed luxuriously, and we could not learn much about him without first poking our fingers into them. According to the tome mentioned (to which we must return him before morning), Mr. Bodie is sixty-three, has exhibited in the Royal Academy, and is at present unmarried. They do not proclaim him comparatively obscure: they left it indeed to him to say the final word on this subject, and he has hedged. Let us put it in this way, that he occupies more space in his wicker chair than in the book, where nevertheless he looks as if it was rather lonely not to be a genius. He is a painter for the nicest of reasons, that it is delightful to live and die in a messy studio ^ for our part, we too should have </p><p>become a painter had it not been that we always lost </p><p>1 </p><p>1

There is no spirited bidding to acquire Mr. Bodie^s canvases : he loves them at first sight himselfy and has often got up in the night to see how they are faring ; hut ultimately he has turned cold to themy and has even been known to offer themy in lieu of almSy to beggarsy who departed cursing. We have a weakness for persons who donH get
 ow, 
and so cannot help addingy though it is no business of ourSy that Mr. Bodie had private means. Curled up in his wicker chair he is rather like an elderly cupid. We wish we could warn him that the policeman is coming. </p><p>The policeman comes : in his hand the weapon that has knocked down more malefactors than all the batons—the bulVs-eye. He strikes with it now, right and lefty revealingy as if she had just entered the roomy a replica of the Venus of Miloy taller than himself though he is stalwart. It is the first meeting of these twoy buty though a man who can come to the boily he is as little moved by her as she by him. After the first glance she continues her reflections. Her smile over his head vaguely displeases him. For two pins he would arrest her. </p><p>^ 
The lantern finds another objecty more worthy of his attentiony the artist. Mr. Bodie is more restive under the light than was his goddesSy perhaps because he is less accustomed to being stared at. He blinks and sits up. </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="12" title="12" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>3 </p><p>MR. BODiE

 Not that, sir; not at all. </p><p>MR. BODIE 
{pressing his advantage).
 But I insist on begging your pardon, officer. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
I 
don’t see what for, sir. </p><p>MR. BODIE 
{fancying himself).
 For walking uninvited into the abode of a law-abiding London citizen, with whom I have not the pleasure of being acquainted. </p><p>POLICEMAN

{with neat surprise).
 So you 
are, I beg your pardon, officer. </p><p>{With pardonable pride in himself
 
MR. BODIE 
turns on the light. The studio^ as we can now gather from its sloped roof, is at the top of a house ; and its window is heavily screened, otherwise we might see the searchlights through it, showing that we are in the period of the great war. Though no one speaks of Mr. Bodie’s pictures as Bodies, which is the true test of fame, he is </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="13" title="13" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>4 </p><p>A KISS FOR CINDERELLA </p><p>sufficiently eminent not to have works of art painted or scratched on his walls, mercy has been shown even to the panels of his door, and he is handsomely stingy of draperies, The Venus stands so prominent that the studio is evidently hers rather than his. The stove has been brought forward so that he can rest his feet on it, which ever of his easy chairs he is sitting in, and he also falls over it at times when stepping back to consider his latest failure. On a shelf is a large stuffed penguin, which is to be one of the characters in the play, and on each side of this shelf are two or three tattered magazines. We had hankered after giving Mr, Bodie many rows of books, but were well aware that he would get only blocks of wood so cleverly painted to look like books that they would deceive everyone except the audience. Everything may be real on the stage except the books. So there are only a few magazines in the studio {and very likely when the curtain rings up it will be found that they are painted too). But </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="14" title="14" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>5 </p><p>Mr. Bodie was a reader ; he had hooks in another room, and the careworn actor must suggest this by his manner. </p><p>Our policeman is no bookman ; we who write happen to have it f rom himself that he had not bought a hook since he squeezed through the sixth standard : very tight was his waist that day, he told us, and he had to let out every button. Nevertheless it was literature of a sort that first brought him into our ken. He was our local constable : and common interests, as in the vagaries of the moon, gradually made him and us cease to look at each other askance. We fell into the way of chatting with him and giving him the evening papers we had bought to read as we crossed the streets. One of his duties was to herd the vagrant populace under our arches during air-raids, and at such times he could be properly gruff, yet comforting, like one who would at once run in any bomb that fell in his beat. When he had all his flock nicely plastered against the dank walls he would occasionally come to rest beside us. </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="15" title="15" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>6 </p><p>A KISS FOR CINDERELLA </p><p>and thaw, and discuss the newspaper article that had interested him most. It was seldom a war-record ; more frequently it was something on the magazine page, such as a symposium hy the learned on
 ‘ 
Do you Believe in Love at First Sight?* Though reticent in many matters he would face this problem openly; with the guns cracking all around, he woidd ash for our views wistfully; he spoke of love without a blush, as something recognised officially at Scotland Yard. At this time he had been in love, to his own knowledge, for several weeks, but whether the god had struck him at first sight he was not certain ; he was most anxious to know, and it was in the hope of our being able to help him out that he told us his singular story. On his face at such times was often an amazed look, as if he were staring at her rather than at us, and seeing a creature almost beyond belief. Our greatest success was in saying that perhaps she had fallen in love at first sight with him, which on reflection nearly doubled him up. He </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="16" title="16" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>7 </p><p>insisted on knowing what had made us put forward this extraordinary suggestion ; he would indeed scarcely leave our company that nighty and discussed the possibility with us very much as if it were a police case. </p><p>Our policeman^s romance, now to he told, began, as we begin, with his climbing up into Mr. Bodices studio. Mr. Bodie having turned on the light gave him the nasty look that means ^ And now, my man, what can 1 do for you?’ Our policeman, however, was not one to be worsted without striking a blow. He strode to the door, as he has told us, and painted to a light in the passage. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{in his most brow-beating voice, so well known under the arches).
 Look here, sir, it’s that. </p><p>MR. BODIE. 
I don't follow. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
Look at that passage window. (fVith natural pride in language.)
 You are showing too much illumination. </p><p>BODIE. 
Oh ! well, surely— </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{with professional firmness).
 It's </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="17" title="17" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>8 </p><p>A KISS FOR CINDERELLA </p><p>agin the regulations. A party in the neighbouring skylight complains. </p><p>BODiE 
{putting out the light).
 If 
that will do for to-night, 
I ’ll 
have the window boarded up. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
Anything so long as it obscures the illumination. </p><p>BODIE 
{irritated).
 Shuts out the light. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{determinedly).
 Obscures the illumination. </p><p>BODIE 
{on reflection).
 I remember 
now, 
I did have that window boarded up. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{who has himself a 'pretty vein of sarcasm).
 I don't see the boards. </p><p>BODIE. 
Nor do I see the boards. 
{Pondering.) Can she have boned them.^ </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
She.^ 
{He is at once aware that it has become a more dijficult case.) </p><p>BODIE. 
You are right. She is scrupulously honest, and if she took the boards we may be sure that I said she could have them. But that only adds to the mystery. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{obligingly):'
 Mystery </p><p>BODIE. 
Why this passion for collecting </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="18" title="18" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>9 </p><p>boards? Try her with a large board, officer. Extraordinary! </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{heavily).
 I don’t know what you are talking about, sir. Are you complaining of some woman ? </p><p>BODiE. 
Now that is the question. Am I? As you are here, officer, there is something I want to say to you. But I should dislike getting her into trouble. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{stoutly).
 No man what is a man wants to get a woman into trouble unnecessary. </p><p>BODIE 
{much struck).
 That’s true! That
’s absolutely
 true, officer. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{badgered).
 It
’s true, but there’s nothing remarkable about it. </p><p>BODIE. 
Excuse me. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
See here, sir, I 
’m 
just 
an ordinary policeman. </p><p>BODIE. 
I can’t let that pass. If I may say so, you have impressed me most deeply. I wonder if I might ask a favour of you. Would you mind taking off your helmet? As it happens, I have never seen a policeman without his helmet. </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="19" title="19" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>10 </p><p>A KISS FOR CINDERELLA </p><p>{The 'perplexed officer puts his helmet on the table,) </p><p>Thank you. 
{Studying the effect.)
 Of course I knew they took off. You sit also? </p><p>{The policeman sits.) </p><p>Very interesting. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
About this woman, sir— </p><p>BODiE. 
We are coming to her. Perhaps I ought to tell you my name—Mr. Bodie. 
{Indicating the Venus.)
 This is Mrs. Bodie. No, I am not married. It is merely a name given her because she is my ideal. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
You 
gave me a 
turn. </p><p>BODIE. 
Now that I think of it, I believe the name was given to her by the very woman we are talking about. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{producing his note hook).
 To begin with, who is the woman we are talking about ? </p><p>BODIE 
(becoming more serious).
 On the surface, she is just a little drudge. These studios are looked after by a housekeeper, who employs this girl to do the work. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
H’m ! Sleeps 
on 
the premises ? </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="20" title="20" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>11 </p><p>BODiE. 
No; 
she is here from eight 
to 
six. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
Place 
of abode </p><p>BODIE. 
She won’t tell anyone that. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
Aha! What ’s the party’s name? </p><p>BODIE. 
Cinderella. </p><p>{The
 
POLICEMAN 
writes it down unmoved, MR. BODIE 
twinkles.) </p><p>Haven’t you heard that name before? </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
Can’t say I have, sir. But I ’ll make inquiries at the Yard. </p><p>BODIE. 
It was really I who gave her that name, because she seemed such a poor little neglected waif. After the girl in the story-book, you know. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
No, sir, I don’t know. In the Force we find it impossible to keep up with current fiction. </p><p>BODIE. 
She was a girl with a broom. There must have been more in the story than that, but I forget the rest. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
The point is, that 
’s 
not the name she calls herself by. </p><p>BODIE. 
Yes, indeed it is. I think she was </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="21" title="21" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>12 </p><p>A KISS FOR CINDERELLA </p><p>called something else when she came. Miss Thing, or some such name; but she took to the name of Cinderella with avidity, and now she absolutely denies that she ever had any other. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
Parentage 
? </p><p>BODiE 
(now interested in his tale).
 That ’s another odd thing. I seem to remember vaguely her telling me that her parents when alive were very humble persons indeed. Touch of Scotch about her, I should say—^perhaps from some distant ancestor; but Scotch words and phrases still stick to the Cockney child like bits of eggshell to a chicken. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
(roriting).
 Egg-shell 
to chicken. </p><p>BODIE. 
I 
find, however, that she has lately been telling the housekeeper quite 
a 
different story. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{like a counsel).
 Proceed. </p><p>BODIE. 
According to this, her people were 
of considerable position—a Baron and Baroness, in fact. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
Proceed. </p><p>BODIE. 
The 
only 
other relatives she seems </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="22" title="22" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>13 </p><p>to have mentioned are two sisters of unprepossessing appearance. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{cleverly).
 If this story is correct, what is she doing here? </p><p>BODiE. 
I understand there is something about her father having married again, and her being badly treated. She doesn’t expect this to last. It seems that she has reason to believe that some very remarkable change may take place in her circumstances at an early date, at a ball for which her godmother is to get her what she calls an invite. This is evidently to be a very swagger function at which something momentous is to occur, the culminating moment being at midnight. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{writing).
 Godmother. Invite. Twelve 
p.m. 
Fishy! Tell me about them boards now. </p><p>BODIE 
{who is evidently fond of the child).
 You can’t think how wistful she is to get hold of boards. She has them on the brain. Carries them off herself into the unknown. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
I daresay she breaks them up for firewood. </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="23" title="23" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>14 </p><p>A KISS FOR CINDERELLA </p><p>BODiE. 
No; 
she makes them into large boxes. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{sagaciously)
.
 Very likely 
to 
keep things in. </p><p>BODIE. 
She has admitted that she keeps things in them. But what things.^ Ask her that, and her mouth shuts like a trap. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
Any suspicions.^ </p><p>(mr. BODIE 
hesitates. It seems absurd to suspect this waif—and yet!) </p><p>BODIE. 
I ’m sorry to say I have. I don’t know what the things are, but I do know they are connected in some way with Germany. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{darkly).
 
Proceed. </p><p>BODIE 
{really troubled).
 
Officer, she is too curious about Germany. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
That
’s 
bad. </p><p>BODIE. 
She plies me with questions about it —not openly—very cunningly. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
Such as
—? </p><p>BODIE. 
For instance, what would be the punishment for an English person caught hiding aliens in this country 
? </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
If she 
’s up 
to games of that kind— </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="24" title="24" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>15 </p><p>BODiE. 
Does that shed any light on the boxes, do you think ? </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
She can’t keep them shut up in boxes. </p><p>BODIE. 
I don’t know. She 
is 
extraordinarily dogged. She knows a number of German words. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
That’s 
ugly. </p><p>BODIE. 
She asked me lately how one could send a letter to Germany without Lord Haig knowing. By the way, do you, by any chance, know anything against a firm of dressmakers called 
Celeste et Cie. ? </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
Celest A. C. 
?
 No, but it has a German sound. </p><p>BODIE. 
It’s
 French. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
Might be a blind. </p><p>BODIE. 
I think she lives at Celeste’s. Now I looked up Celeste et Cie. in the telephone book, and I find they are in Bond Street. Immensely fashionable. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
She lives in Bond Street 
?
 London ’s full of romance, sir, to them as knows where to look for it—namely, the police. Is she on the premises 
? </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="25" title="25" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>16 </p><p>A KISS FOR CINDERELLA </p><p>BODiE 
{reluctantly
). Sure to be; it isn’t six yet. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{in his most terrible voice).
 Well, leave her to me. </p><p>BODIE. 
You mustn’t frighten her. I can’t help liking her. She ’s so extraordinarily homely
 that you can’t be with her many minutes before you begin thinking of your early days. Where were you born, officer.? </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
I ’m from Badgery. </p><p>BODIE. 
She 
’ll 
make you think of Badgery. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{frowning).
 She had best try 
no games 
on 
me. </p><p>BODIE. 
She will have difficulty in answering questions; she is so used to asking them. I never knew a child with such an appetite for information. She doesn’t search for it in books; indeed the only book of mine I can remember ever seeing her read, was a volume of fairy tales. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{stupidly).
 Well, that don’t help us much. What kind of questions ? </p><p>BODIE. 
Every kind. What is the Censor.? Who is Lord 
Times 
?—she has heard people here talking of that paper and its proprietor, and has mixed them up in the quaintest way; then again </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="26" title="26" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>17 </p><p>—when a tailor measures a gentleman’s legs what does he mean when he says—

The penny? It 
*s
 plain the first thing to find out is whether she’s the slavey she seems to be, or a swell in disguise. </p><p>BODiE. 
You 
won’t find it 
so easy. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
Excuse me, sir; we have an infalla

/ble way at Scotland Yard of finding out whether a woman is common or a lady. </p><p>BODIE 
{irritated).
 An infallible way. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{firmly
). Inf

I should like to know what it is. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
There is nothing against my telling you. 
{He settles down to a masterly crossexamination.)
 Where, sir, does a common 
. female keep her valuables when she carries them about on her person? </p><p>BODIE. 
In 
her pocket, 
I 
suppose. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
And you suppose correctly. But where does a lady keep them? </p><p>BODIE. 
In 
the same place, 
I 
suppose. </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="27" title="27" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>18 </p><p>A KISS FOR CINDERELLA </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
Then you suppose wrongly. No, sir, here. 
{He taps his own chest, and indicates discreetly how a lady may pop something down out of sight,) </p><p>BODiE 
{impressed).
 I believe you are right, officer. </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
I am right—it’s infallayble. A lady, what with drink and such like misfortunes, may forget all her other refinements, but she never forgets that. At the Yard 
it’s
 considered as sure as finger-marks. </p><p>BODIE. 
Strange! I wonder who was the first woman to do it. It couldn’t have been Eve this time, officer. </p><p>POLICEMAN 
{after reflecting)
. I see your point. And now I want just to have a look at the party unbeknownst to her. Where could I conceal myself 
? </p><p>BODIE.

? </p><p>POLICEMAN. 
Conceal myself. </p><p>BODIE. 
That small door opens on to my pantry, where she washes up. </p><p>POLICEMAN

This is her usual mode of entrance, and is owing to her desire to give satisfaction.) </p><p>Our policeman, as he has told us under the arches, was watching her through the heyhole, hut his first impressions have been so coloured by subsequent events that it is questionable whether they would be accepted in any court of law. Is prepared to depose that to the best of his recollection, they were unfavourable. Does not imply by un~ favourable any aspersion on her personal appearance. Would accept the phrase 'far from striking’ as summing up her first appearance. Would no longer accept the phrase. Had put her down as being a grown woman, but not sufficiently grown. Thought her hair looked to be run up her finger. Did not like this way of doing the hair. Could not honestly say that she seemed even then to be an ordinary slavey of the areas. She was dressed as one, but was suspiciously clean. On the other hand, she had the genuine hungry look. Among </p><span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="30" title="30" epub:type="pagebreak"/><p>21 </p><p>more disquieting features noticed a sort of refinement in her voice and manner, which was characteristic of the criminal classes. Knew now that this was caused hy the reading of fairy tales and the thinking of noble thoughts. Noted speedily that she was a domineering character who talked sixteen to the dozen, and at such times reminded him of funny old ladies. Was much struck hy her eyes, which seemed to suggest that she was all burning inside. This impression was strengthened later when he touched her hands. Felt at once the curious ^homeliness^ of her, as commented on by Mr. Bodie, but could swear on oath that this had not at once made him think of Badgery. Could recall not the slightest symptoms of love at first sight. On the contrary, listened carefully to the conversation between her and Mr. Bodie and formed a stern conclusion about her. Believed that this was all he could say about his first impression. </p><p>CINDERELLA

She is again a valiant soul who has had too many brushes with the police not to be able to face another with a tight lip. She is going, but she is not going without her wooden board ; law or no law she cannot do without wooden boards. She gets it from a corner where it has been artfully concealed. An imprudent glance at the Venus again dispirits her. With a tape she takes the Beauty^s measurements and then her own, with depressing results. The Gods at last pity her, and advise an examination of her rival’s foot. Excursions, alarms, transport. She compares feet and is glorified. She slips off her shoe and challenges Venus to put it on.
